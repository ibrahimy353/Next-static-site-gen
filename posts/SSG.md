# Why should I create a blog?
Thats what I first asked myself.For quiet some time I have been curious to know how bloging sites like TUKO, Ghafla and Kahawatungu have been created and which tech stacks they have they been created in. This curiousity lead me to conduct a research on how they come up. 
From one article to another trying to understand on how they one can create a blog from scratch up to the point of deploying it so that it can be shared online.
