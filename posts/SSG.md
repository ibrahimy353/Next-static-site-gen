# Why should I create a blog?
Creating a blog can be a great way to express your thoughts, share your knowledge and build a community, . If you've ever been curious about how popular blogging sites like TUKO, Ghafla, and Kahawatungu were created and the tech stacks they used, you're not alone. As I embarked on my own research to understand the process of creating a blog from scratch to deployment, I discovered a vast wealth of information and resources available online. Through this journey, I learned how to create a blog based on the programming language I am conversant with and deploy it online, and now I'm excited to share my knowledge with you. In this website, I'll guide you through the steps of creating your own blog, using Next JS and Markdown file that stores the information to deploying it online and sharing it with the world.

Before starting to design on how I wanted the blog to appear, Its important to know the flow in which the written information on the markdown folder will be converted upto the last step of getting the output. Bellow is the workflow diagram on how we shall get the desired output.  

Here is a rough idea of how the project will flow. Picture design setup.

Once the information is fully processed on your end then you can then get share the new blog post.
